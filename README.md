# Fokred version of Generator for Dactyl & Dactyl Manuform Keyboards

This is a fork of [the ibnuba fork](https://github.com/ibnuda/dactyl-keyboard) which is a fork of [the tshort fork](https://github.com/tshort/dactyl-keyboard) which is a form of the [Dactyl](https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard), a parameterized, split-hand, concave, columnar, ergonomic keyboard.

To tinker around follow these "old" steps:

1. Install JDK and [leiningen](https://leiningen.org/#install).
2. Change directory to this repository.
3. Edit and save something in `src/dactyl_keyboard/common.clj` etc..
4. Run `lein repl`.
5. Run `(load-file "src/dactyl_keyboard/common.clj") (load-file "src/dactyl_keyboard/manuform.clj")`
6. Open / wait for SCAD files to update.
7. Render in SCAD
8. Export to STL
9. Slice STL file using 3d printer software.
10. print and assemble your keyboard!

Here is a preview of the keyboard in a 3d printer slicing software (IdeaMaker).
